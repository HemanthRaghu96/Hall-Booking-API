# Hall Booking API

I have created a server. \
/rooms endpoint allow user to add rooms in database. \
/bookings endpoint allow user to book a room. \
/rooms/bookings allow user to list all Rooms with Booked Data. \
/customers/bookings allow user to list all customers with booked Data. \
/customer/:name allow user to list how many times a customer has booked the room. \
I have used express for creating server and used atlas mongoDB for storing data in database.
