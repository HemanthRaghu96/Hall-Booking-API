# Hall Booking API

I have created a server. \
https://hall-booking-api-nber.onrender.com/rooms -> endpoint allow user to add rooms in database. \
https://hall-booking-api-nber.onrender.com/bookings -> endpoint allow user to book a room. \
https://hall-booking-api-nber.onrender.com/rooms/bookings -> allow user to list all Rooms with Booked Data. \
https://hall-booking-api-nber.onrender.com/customers/bookings -> allow user to list all customers with booked Data. \
https://hall-booking-api-nber.onrender.com/customers/:name -> allow user to list how many times a customer has booked the room. \
I have used express for creating server and used atlas mongoDB for storing data in database.
